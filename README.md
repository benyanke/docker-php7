# PHP 7 docker image

This is a [Docker](http://www.docker.com) image for [PHP 7](http://php.net/) suited to run [Laravel PHP Framework](http://laravel.com/).

An automated build for this repo is available on the [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/benyanke/php7/).

This is a fork of (vcarreira/php7)[https://github.com/vcarreira/docker-php7].

This includes php 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3, linked to docker tags `7.1`, `7.2`, and `7.3`.

This image works is used across the [Docker Laravel](https://github.com/vcarreira/docker-laravel) multi-container solution.

Images used by this:
  - [benyanke/nginx-php7-fpm](https://hub.docker.com/r/benyanke/nginx-php7-fpm) 

## New Packages and Modules

I intend these images to be as flexible as possible, so if you need additional PHP modules, please request it, 
or put in a PR to add it.
